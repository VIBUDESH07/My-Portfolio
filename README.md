- npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   npm start
   ```

   The development server should start and you can view the portfolio in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

Tailwind CSS is already set up for you. Make sure you have a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project. If not, you can generate it with:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file includes the paths to your source files:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Customizing Tailwind CSS

You can customize Tailwind CSS by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file and the `src/index.css` file where you import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities.

**Example `src/index.css`:**

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Usage

- **Add Projects:** Edit the `src/components/Projects.js` file to include your projects.
- **Update Skills:** Modify the `src/components/Skills.js` file to list your skills.
- **Contact Form:** Implement the contact form in `src/components/Contact.js` if you want to include one. You may need a backend service to handle form submissions.

## Deployment

You can deploy your portfolio using various platforms such as:

- **Vercel:** Connect your GitHub repository and deploy with automatic updates on push.
- **Netlify:** Similar to Vercel, provides easy deployment and continuous integration.
